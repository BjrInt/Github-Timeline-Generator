# Github Timeline Generator

A web interface to customize your github timeline!

## How?

Simply load the website and fill the squares. Once you get a pattern that you like, hit the export button to download a shell script.
You just need to create an empty directory, place the script inside of it and execute it. This will generate a bunch of commits that match the pattern you created.

You'll then have to publish it to Github and enjoy.

## Does this even work ?

I created a dummy github profile to test the app, and so far it works flawlessly. [You can check it out here](https://github.com/MyFirstDevProfile?tab=overview&from=2022-10-01&to=2022-10-07).

## Why use it?

### As a canvas?

In the world of technology and personal branding, customizing one's timeline can be viewed as an art form that allows developers to express their unique identities and creative visions. Just as an artist uses a canvas to convey their emotions and ideas, developers have the opportunity to craft a visually appealing and personalized timeline that reflects their individuality and professional style.

### As a data visualization tool?

Dummy commits can be used to generate realistic data sets for data visualization projects or analytics purposes. You can simulate different patterns of commits to test visualizations, assess statistical models, or analyze trends.

### As a learning material

This tool provides a linear graph of hundreds, if not thousands of commit, only using genuine git commands. I sure learned a bit while doing it, but maybe there are still things to learn. Could it generate branches, create more meaningful code contribution or commit message ? How could this kind of project be automatically flagged as non-genuine and how could it be improved to be seamless?

### As a short term profile boost?

I understand the importance of establishing a strong online presence for developers and showcasing their skills effectively. One aspect that often comes into play is the measurement of a developer's worthiness based on their GitHub contributions. However, I have come to realize that relying solely on GitHub contributions may not accurately represent the true value and expertise of a developer.

Consider this: some developers commit frequently to artificially boost their numbers, while others invest substantial time and effort into a single commit, resulting in the same impactful outcome. It's evident that the quantity of commits does not necessarily reflect the quality or depth of a developer's work. Yet many recruiters will still use that metric as a reference.

## A short piece of advice and disclaimer

It's important to note that this tool is easily recognizable and distinguishable from genuine contributions on GitHub. While it offers a means to simulate commits, it is crucial to understand that using the tool carries certain responsibilities and potential risks. As the creator of the tool, I explicitly decline any liabilities that may arise from its usage.

By acknowledging the tool's distinguishable nature, users should be aware that artificially boosting their GitHub contributions using this tool may lead to misrepresentation or misunderstandings about their actual coding activity. It is essential for users to exercise ethical judgment and consider the potential consequences before employing the tool.
